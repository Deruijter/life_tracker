# Life Tracker

This is an app aimed at keeping track of various statistics thrughout ones life. It's set up in a flexible manner so you can define your own tracker. Currently four tracker types are included: 
- Counter: Keep a tally on whatever you're tracking, simply increase or decrease the number of occurrences using plus and minus buttons
- Timer: Time how long certain activities last. This functions simply by pressing play and stop at the appropriate times.
- Text: Write text notes
- Monitor: Keep track of numerical values and how they change over time.

During any registration of tracking the time and (optionally) location are stored. This means that your behavior can be easily analyzed and displayed.

Examples of the use of this app are as broad as you can imagine them but could include:
- Keep track of medication use or occurrence of medical problems such as when a headache occurs.
- Keep track of the duration of your activities such as time spent in the gym, studying, or partying.
- Include notes so you can store additional information, for example "I fell on the ice and hit my head today", or "I went to my sisters wedding today".
- Keep track of changes over time such as your weight or blood pressure, or your bench-press record.

Planned features included improved reporting on the tracked data, the creation of assembly reports where a report is generated using multiple trackers, the creation of different overview screens so that you can easily switch between different trackers (for example, a medical overview screen, a social overview screen, or a physical activity overview screen).
